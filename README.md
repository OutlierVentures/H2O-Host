# H2O-Host

Provider of the OrbitDB database for H2O.

If you want to try different datasets, there is a framework Python script in the `data` folder for generating nice, clusterable datasets.


### Roadmap

1. Stabilise closing of IPFS/OrbitDB connection
2. Implement read-only replication
3. Make vertical/horizontal arrays consistent in data
